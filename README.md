# Button-Counter Project
# CSCI 490 Mobile App

Created an app that has three buttons, one for incrementing a counter, one for decrementing the counter, and one for resetting the counter to 0. The counter retains its state when rotating between portrait and landscape.
The WOW factor implemented was modifying the colors.xml file in the res folder.
